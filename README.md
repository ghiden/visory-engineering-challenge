# Visory Engineering Challenge

## Original Requirements

- We can filter by location
- We can provide a start and end datetime
- Your code is well-tested
- The README.md has been update with instructions to build and run your code

## Scoped Requirements

To simplify the UI, I have added the following constraints:

- Events are only searchable in Australia
- Location search is based on city name in Australia

## Setup

First, prepare both backend and frontend.
Once both backend and frontend are running, you can browse the backend service from frontend by accessing http://localhost:4200

### Backend

Follow the README in the directory:

```
cd backend
```

### Frontend

Follow the README in the directory:

```
cd frontend
```
